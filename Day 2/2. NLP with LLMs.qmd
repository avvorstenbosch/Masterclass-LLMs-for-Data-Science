## NLP-lifecycle on it's head

\
Regular ML:\
Problem &rarr; Idea &rarr; Gather data &rarr; Train Model &rarr; Evaluate Model &rarr;\
<span class="highlighted-text">Repeat if neccessary</span> &rarr; deploy\
Duration: Months\
\
\

Prompting workflow:\
Problem &rarr; Idea &rarr; Gather (less) data &rarr; Finetune prompt &rarr; Evaluate Model &rarr;\
<span class="highlighted-text">Repeat if neccessary</span> &rarr; already deployed\
Duration: Days

## NLP-tasks

- Sentiment analysis
- Named entity recognition
- Natural language generation
- Speech recognition
- Speech synthesis
- Ontology population
- Question answering
- Machine translation
- Summarisation
- Classification
- Topic modeling

## Jack of all trades, master of none...
- LLMs are great at a wide range of tasks...
- ... but they aren't state-of-the-art for specific tasks
- (might also be skewed due to allignment problem between benchmarks and human-eval in some)

## ... Except for QA and Reasoning
- They are [SOTA](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.10403v3.pdf) for <span class="highlighted-text">Question Answering</span> and <span class="highlighted-text">Reasoning</span> 
- Might fit into the Jack of all trades analogy.
- Will score great on any subject overall, but not the best in class in any single subject


## Sentiment analysis

## But not state-of-the-art for others
- Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis. 
    - The service was great but the food was terrible
        - service: positive
        - food: negative
