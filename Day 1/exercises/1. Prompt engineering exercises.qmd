# Exercise: Create a Basic Prompt 
Using the general prompting template provided in the slides, create a prompt that asks the language model to act a personal tutor for you. Make the model explain to you what a transformer is. Specify the:

- ROLE, 
- TASK_DESCRIPTION,
- TASK_SPECIFICATION,
- and FORMAT_OUTPUT.

## try some variations
Try experimenting with some variations of this yourself. Change the role, task, and output format. How does the model respond to these changes? 

# Exercise: Order of Operations *(patched?)*
## Answer first
Give ChatGPT the task to multiply 3 numbers together, which are at least 3 digits in length.
Specify the output such that ChatGPT first gives you the result of the multiplication, and only then it gives you the 3 numbers.
What do you see happening?

## Answer last
Do the same, but now reverse the order. Make sure ChatGPT first gives you the 3 numbers, and then make it calculate the multiplication. Is anything different, why?

# Exercise: Order of Operations + room to think
## Answer first
Let the model check the answer below. First, only allow the model to answer with the verdict correct or incorrect. Then ask for the explanation in the next message.
```python
f"""
Determine if my answer below is correct.

I'm trying to figure out how expensive my prompting of the GPT4 API will be in total.
I'm going to run around 1000 prompts. For these prompts, the average prompt-lengt is 250 words.
The average response length of the model for these prompts is 300 words. 

The API pricing is as follows:
$0.03/1k prompt tokens.
$0.06/1k sampled tokens.

We can assume that 1 token is on average 3/4th of a single word. 

I found the following answer:
18 dollars.
"""
```

## Answer last
Now do the same, but instruct the model to first work through the problem itself. Ask it to **think step by step**.

## Reflection
Why would it help language models to work step-by-step?

# Exercise: Spelling
1. Ask the model the reverse the word: "congratulations".
2. Ask the model to reverse the word and spell it out letter-by-letter.
What do you see? Why do you think this happens.

## A closer look
Use the [openai-tokenizer](https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer) to look at the words? What do you see?

## Self-reflection
Ask the model whether the answer it gave was correct, what happens? Why do you think this is the case?

### Self-reflection on the API-costs questions
If the answer given was incorrect, see how it responds if you ask it to reflect on the answer given.

# Few-shot prompting + Chain-of-thoughts
One simple but time consuming task you might often do is to take notes during a meeting, then type these out into a mail to send to the team. However, how you take notes is very specific to you, just like how you want and need the mail to look.

We can guide the model by giving it a few examples of our task, this is called *Few-shot prompting.* Also, I want you to take into consideration the order of operations and how to go from meeting notes to this email. 

**\textcolor{red}{Please don't send any private or proprietary information to third parties.}** 
You can use ficticious meeting notes if you'd like.
