# Exercise: Create a Basic Prompt 
Using the general prompting template provided in the slides, create a prompt that asks the language model to act a personal tutor for you. Make the model explain to you what a transformer is. Specify the ROLE, TASK_DESCRIPTION, TASK_SPECIFICATION, and FORMAT_OUTPUT.

## Exercise
What happens when you run the same prompt, but remove the ROLE specification.

# Exercise: Order of Operations
## Answer first
Give ChatGPT the task to multiply 3 numbers together, which are at least 3 digits in length.
Specify the output such that ChatGPT first gives you the result of the multiplication, and only then it gives you the 3 numbers.
What do you see happening?

## Answer last
Do the same, but now reverse the order. Make sure ChatGPT first gives you the 3 numbers, and then make it calculate the multiplication. Is anything different, why?

# Exercise: Spelling
1. Ask the model the reverse the word: "congratulations".
2. Ask the model to reverse the word and spell it out letter-by-letter.
What do you see? Why do you think this happens.

## A closer look
Use the [openai-tokenizer](https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer) to look at the words? What do you see?
