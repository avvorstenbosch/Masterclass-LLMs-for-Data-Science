# What is ChatGPT?
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
- A Large Language model trained on enormous amounts of data:
    - Which was instruction tuned
    - Which was finetuned with RLHF
- Which resulted in:
    - *Extremely* impressive Chatbot capabilities
    - *Much* better interaction and
    - *Much* better language understanding while also 
    - *Accessible* to use for **Anybody**

# A brief history of LLMs
## Next-word prediction machine
$$P(token_n|token_{n-1}, \cdots, token_1)$$

A token: *a single character, a combination of characters, or a word*

## Next-word prediction machine
$$P(token_n|token_{n-1}, \cdots, token_1)$$

This is nothing new, your phone does something similair:

# Capabilities of ChatGPT
## But very powerfull with many strong properties:
- Understand language conventions (syntax, grammer, etc.)
- Can answer questions (Have internal knowledge, )
- Can code
- Can write just like humans, and in specific styles
- Can do some basic arithmatic
- Can understand sentiment, style, etc.
- Can do logical reasoning (too some extent)

## Large language models imply the existence of small language models


## A brief history of NLP
- Classic ML: Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF etc.
- Word2Vec - Neural Informative Representations
- Transformers - Context based representations
- GPT2 Keep scaling this up
- Scaling laws --> Large language models i.e. GTP3
- `emergent` properties
- Instruction-tuning and RLHF --> ChatGPT

## How does a LLM work
- Training:
    - Pretraining
    - Finetuning
    - RLHF

- Processing data:
    - BPE-tokenizer
    - Embeddings
    - (Self-)Attention Mechanism 
    - output softmax predictions (with temperature)
