# Introduction to prompting

## Introduction to prompting
- Prompts are a `natural (language)` way to interact with language models
    - very easy to understand
    - anybody can do it
- Enables `Semantic coding` instead of `logical coding`
- This makes it very easy and very fast to itterate

## NLP-lifecycle on it's head

Regular ML:
Problem -> Idea -> Gather data -> Train Model -> Evaluate Model -> `Repeat if neccessary` -> deploy
Duration: Months

Prompting workflow:
Problem -> Idea -> Gather data -> Finetune prompt -> Evaluate Model -> `Repeat if neccessary` -> deploy
Duration: Days

## Best techniques for prompting

- Make use of a general prompting template 
- Be precise in your description
- 'No' is also an answer
- Use delimiters to mark sections of your prompt
- Give LLMs room to think
- Take into account the order of operations 
- Guide complex problems with chain-of-thought prompting
- Split tasks into simpler subtasks
- Mind the Context Window

## General prompting template
- A general decent prompt templates looks like the following:
- Specify which ROLE the model should assume.
- Specify the task it should perform:
    - TASK_DESCRIPTION: What is the task.
    - TASK_SPECIFICATION: Specify how the task should be performed
    - FORMAT_OUTPUT: (Optional) Specify how the answer should be given.
```{python}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| output: false
f"""
ROLE: {ROLE}
TASK: {TASK_DESCRIPTION}
      {TASK_SPECIFICATION}
      {FORMAT_OUTPUT}
"""
```

## General prompting template
::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
- A general decent prompt templates looks like the following:
- Specify which ROLE the model should assume.
- Specify the task it should perform:
    - TASK_DESCRIPTION: What is the task.
    - TASK_SPECIFICATION: Specify how the task should be performed
    - FORMAT_OUTPUT: (Optional) Specify how the answer should be given.
- Don't take the role too far: You might go '*out-of-distribution*'

## Be precise in your task descriptions

You may think your task is clear, but it may not be:

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="25%"}
 
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

*As I'm going to the store, my roommate asks me:*
*'Can you get a gallon of milk? And if they have eggs, get 6.'*

*When I come home my roommate was in shock: "You got 6 gallons of milk?!"*
*I responded 'They had eggs.'*

::: {.column width="25%"}

## Be precise in your task descriptions
- LLMs don't know anything about you or the task it is given.
- "Please explain to me how LLMs works?"
    - What is your background knowledge? Academic, high-school, etc..
    - What type of explanation? Technical, simple summary, etc..
    - How long should it be? 5 paragraphs, 5 sentences, etc..
    - Do you need references? 
    - etc... 

## Use delimiters

- Indicates what describes the task at hand, and what the task should be performed on
- use either: 
    - *### TEXT ###* 
    - *""" TEXT """* 
    - *''' TEXT '''* 
    - These triplets are all a single token
- Or use clear section titles, HTML-tags, etc.

## Include a reference text
::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
- LLMs should not be trusted with giving specific information, they can make up completely nonsence answers
- These answers are called <span class="highlighted-text">Hallucinations</span>, more on them later.

## Include a reference text
- To help mitigate this (partially), you can Include a reference text^[[OpenAI GPT guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt-best-practices/strategy-provide-reference-text)]
```{python}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| output: false
f"""
ROLE: {ROLE}
TASK: {TASK_DESCRIPTION}
      Your task is to answer the question using only the provided document 
      and to cite the passage(s) of the document used to answer the question.
      The answer must be annotated with a citation. 
      Use the following format to cite relevant passages ({'citation' : …}).
      {FORMAT_OUTPUT}

DOCUMENT:
'''
{DOCUMENT}
'''

"""
```

## 'No' is also an answer! 
- To help mitigate this (partially), you can Include a reference text^[[OpenAI GPT guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt-best-practices/strategy-provide-reference-text)]
- Explicitly tell the model to not answer the question if it can't.
```{python}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| output: false
f"""
ROLE: {ROLE}
TASK: {TASK_DESCRIPTION}
      Your task is to answer the question using only the provided document 
      and to cite the passage(s) of the document used to answer the question.
      If the document does not contain the information needed to answer this question 
      then simply write: 
        'Insufficient information.' 
      If an answer to the  question is provided, it must be annotated with a citation. 
      Use the following format to cite relevant passages ({'citation' : …}).
      {FORMAT_OUTPUT}

DOCUMENT:
'''
{DOCUMENT}
'''

"""
```

## Give models time-to-think {.smaller}

Determine if my answer below is correct.

I'm trying to figure out how expensive my prompting of the GPT4 API will be in total.
I'm going to run around 1000 prompts. For these prompts, the average prompt-lengt is 250 words.
The average response length of the model for these prompts is 300 words. 

The API pricing is as follows:
$0.03/1k prompt tokens.
$0.06/1k sampled tokens.

We can assume that 1 token is on average 3/4th of a single word. 
What


First work out your own solution to the problem. Then compare your solution to the given solution and evaluate if the given solution is correct or not. Don't decide if the student's solution is correct until you have done the problem yourself.

I found the following answer:
18 dollars.

## Take into account the order-of-operations {.smaller}
- First give calculation steps, then give the answer.
- Otherwise the model tries to retrofit the computation to the answer.

## Chain-of-thought prompting

- Some tasks are complicated for a LLM, based on just the prompt
- Give the model room to think with Chain-of-Thought prompting
- Chain-of-Thought prompting is essentially single or few-shot prompting for reasoning:
EXAMPLE: FEW_SHOT_LEARNING
- Even zero-shot chain-of-thought prompting works *Let's think step by step*
- That this works, is one of the emergent properties of LLMs

## Chain-of-thought prompting
You can already improve performance by just adding:
"Let's think step by step." at the end of a prompt
