 - Example question:
    - Write code to find the <span class="highlighted-text"> second </span> largest number in the sequence.
    - {3, 1, 4, 5, 3, 2}
        -  4

## Exam Evaluation - Dr. Nick Koning

There are 3 scenarios:

1. Code runs and wit right answers AutoTest: *full points*

2. Code runs, but get's wrong answers: *Needs to be manually checked*

3. Code doesn't run: *Needs to be manually checked*



- Manually checking code for 400 students is a lot of work
    - Can we automate this?
    - ChatGPT??


## Exam Evaluation - Dr. Nick Koning

How did he do it:

- Webinterface was not an option, used the API
- Organise students questions in seperate files

![](./figures/NK-API-coding.png){fig-align="right"}

## Exam Evaluation - Dr. Nick Koning

Quick observation:

- Out-of-the-box ChatGPT does not work
- Mediocre and inconsistent quality

Start Small!

- Just 3 students
- First graded them manually
- Main advantage of starting small:
    - Fast
    - Cheap
    - Able to keep overview
- Spent 90% of time on finetuning prototype

## Exam Evaluation - Dr. Nick Koning
Integrated into exam environment:

- Exams are graded as soon as student hands-in the work

- Feedback + preliminary result in 2 minutes ...

- ... not 2 weeks

- Human-in-the-loop: Grading serves as input for the TA's
    - And if you don't agree there is room for an appeal

- Broadly available via the [CodeGrade](https://www.codegrade.com/)

## Exam Evaluation - Dr. Nick Koning

Suggestions for next steps:

-   Finetune a model for grading:
    - Show don't tell: It allows for more concise prompts as you've shown it what answers you expect
    - Should align GPT grades better with TA grades

-   Ask the model for Json output:
    - Can use JSON mode introduced on [Devday](https://openai.com/blog/new-models-and-developer-products-announced-at-devday)   
    - No need for regex parsing of response anymore

## GPT4 answering patient questions in Groningen

![[UMCG beantwoordt vragen patiënten met hulp van AI](https://nieuws.umcg.nl/w/umcg-beantwoordt-vragen-pati%C3%ABnten-met-hulp-van-ai)](./figures/umc-groningen.webp)

## GPT4 answering patient questions in Groningen

- UMCG get's up to 1200 patient questions a week
- Hospital staff has little time to answers such questions 

## GPT4 answering patient questions in Groningen

- GPT4 integrated securely inside the EPD:
    - Access to the relevant healthrecords
- Colaboration between EPIC (EPD company) and Microsoft. 

## GPT4 answering patient questions in Groningen

- Human-in-the-loop: GPT4 writes a draft
- Healthcare providers can correct and/or expand on answer given
- Research suggests people actually prefer GPT answers

## Physicians versus GPT

[Comparing Physician and Artificial Intelligence Chatbot Responses to Patient Questions Posted to a Public Social Media Forum](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2804309)

- Chatbot responses preferred in 78.6% (95% CI, 75.0%-81.8%) of the 585 evaluations. 
- Response length: physicians 52 [17-62] words vs Chatbot 211 [168-245] words
- The proportion of good or very good quality responses was higher for chatbot than physicians (chatbot: 78.5%, 95% CI, 72.3%-84.1%; physicians: 22.1%, 95% CI, 16.4%-28.2%;). 
- The proportion of responses rated empathetic or very empathetic (≥4) was higher for chatbot than for physicians (physicians: 4.6%, 95% CI, 2.1%-7.7%; chatbot: 45.1%, 95% CI, 38.5%-51.8%)

## GPT4 answering patient questions in Groningen

- Win-win
    - Less pressure for doctors
    - Better answers for patients

## Healthcare specific LLMs such as med-PaLM2

## Khanmigo as a socratic super tutor
- Get personalised help over a wide range of topics
- Socratic method based:
    - Not giving answers
    - Instead, ask thought provoking questions
    - Less risk of bad answers due to isolated environment

# Finding the right context to answer the question
## Finding the right context to answer the question

- These solutions all have the following in common:
    - LLM embedded in nicely defined context
    - Most relevant information directly at hand as context for the model

- But what if finding the right context becomes harder?

## {.full-bg-slide background-image="./figures/retrieval-augmented-generation2.png"}

## Practical assignment day 2

- We're going to implement our own RAG system
- Open question - is R really suitable for this?
    - Little support for NLP compared to Python
    - Basics should be fine

- I want to encourage creativity:
    - If you have your own idea for a project...
    - Or if you have your own dataset to work with...
    - ...Contact me and we can see if we can get it too work.
