This prompting cheatsheet will show you some ideas you can apply yourself for how you can use LLMs, as well as how to write better prompts. This list is obviously not exhaustive; the possibilities are endless!

# General prompting template
\begin{mdframed}[style=mystyle]
\textbf{Role}: \{\textit{What/who does the model act like?}\}\newline
\textbf{Task}: \{\textit{What do we want the model to do?}\}\newline
\phantom{\textbf{Role}:  }\{\textit{How do we want the model to do this?}\}\newline
\phantom{\textbf{Role}:  }\{\textit{How should the model format the reply?}\}\newline
\end{mdframed}

Using this general prompting template, we can specify any task we want the model to perform, along with any role it should assume while doing so. Use this as a startingpoint to write any of the promps you want to write.\newline
Note that you can, but don't have to, include the 'Role:' or 'Task:' tags. This is up to your own preference, it can help with the readability. I tend to do the following:

\begin{mdframed}[style=mystyle]
\textbf{Role}: \{\textit{What/who does the model act like?}\}\newline
\textbf{Task}: 
\{\textit{What do we want the model to do?}\}\newline
\phantom{\textbf{Role}:  }\{\textit{How do we want the model to do this?}\}\newline
\phantom{\textbf{Role}:  }\{\textit{How should the model format the reply?}\}\newline
\textbf{Question}: \{\textit{The specific question for this conversation}\}
\newline
\end{mdframed}

Where the first 4 steps of the prompt are just a general template you can reuse, and the 'Question' contains the information specific to this prompt.

In the rest of this cheatsheet I will give a few examples for prompts you can use in your daily life.
