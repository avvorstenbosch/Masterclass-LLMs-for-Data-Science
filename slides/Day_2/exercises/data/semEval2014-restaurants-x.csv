158;We were fast to order the appetizer platter since we were very hungry.
1546;Maybe I say so because it looked promising for people who like artery-clogging jewish deli food, but turns out to be poorly run and awful.
1747;Wait staff is blantently unappreciative of your business but its the best pie on the UWS!

1039;The decor is really blah, and not at all hip or happening.
1547;It appears to be the owner's first venture and it shows.

149;It's great to go for a quick lunch either alone or with a friend.
1713;Other than being a little crowded and a bit overpriced, the atmosphere is filled with energy (and the beautiful people of course) and the food was surprising good!
1323;The music is the best among all the Indian restaurants I have visited.
1322;one of the best Chicken Tikka Masala.
184;The kitchen however, is almost always slow.
1328;Also, the hostess called me today to thank us for coming and mentioned how she hoped that my girlfriend enjoyed her birthday - unexpected, but a truly above and beyond thing to do...
1482;The plain slice is great and if you get toppings, the whole slice is topped with them, not sparsely sprinkled on like some places.

1602;Service is great, takeout is good too.
1473;The pizza is overpriced and soggy.

1591;I loved everythig about it-especially the shows and actors.
1844;Everything looks great, the drinks, the decor, the food, even the people.
1618;We had great desserts (including the best cannoli I've ever had) and then they offered an after dinner drink, on the house.
1800;We asked to be moved (which took half an hour), and then were seated in a high traffic area in the back, even though the rest of the room was practically empty.
1002;The view is spectacular, and the food is great.
1181;The place wasn't too hard to find, but it was kind of packed, as soon as my boyfriend and I got our food, the line reached the door.

1457;My wife and I will usually only order one primi and one secondi and split them, as they tend to offer large portions.
1530;I've overheard comments from him to his employees that should not have been delivered in the dining area and I've been sitting there while he lectured another customer.
1799;Every waitress and customer who passed by me bumped into my chair.
1433;It is run by the same Sichuan chef who started the chain in Chinatown.
1200;If the omakase is to showcase technique and variety, serving almost 40% of items BBQ-ed and a spicy tuna roll wrapped with not-so-fresh nori seems to be a rather limp performance.
1318;It cannot be the ambience, because the place is very cramped and some guests have to sit in an aisle.
1563;Authentic Pakistani food.
1459;The eggplant parmesan is also great, and my friend who grew up in Manhattan claims that no one serves a better baked ziti with meatsauce.
1597;Quality ingredients preparation all around, and a very fair price for NYC.
1441;My entree of hot pot with seafood was full of imitation crabmeat with a couple pieces of shrimp and squid, and was unnecessarily heated with a burner.
1305;In fact, while leaving the place we saw two people looking at the menu, and I couldn't help telling them that the food was horrible.
1438;If you want Americanized Chinese food with your usual watery, generic white sauce, this is your place.
1570;The food however, is what one might expect.
1454;The only possible drawback to this last point is that as of the date of this posting, the additional menu items are only written in Chinese.
1206;The place is small and cramped but the food is fantastic.
1164;The food there is so good that even to order out the wait is incredible.
1846;The highlight of the night was the mayonaisse for my side of fries I received from one of the food runners, which is not good considering the bill was nearly $100.
110;If anyones has doubt of not knowing enough about wines,please check their wine list.
1612;Have the iced tea.
1226;you can actually get 2 salads worth if u take it home and add it to some lettuce!
1182;The food is very good for it's price, better than most fried dumplings I've had.
1303;There are much better places in NY with better prices.
1313;I ate here a week ago and found most dishes average at best and too expensive.
1100;Both times I was extremely dissappointed by the service, which was boarderline rude.
1786;The spicy Tuna roll is huge and probably the best that I've had at this price range.
153;This is one of the best comfort food places in the city.
1346;Overall, the ingredients and technique are there and I am encouraged enough to return at lunch or dinner to see whether the boldness of the flavour palette improves.
1686;Considering their price of $6.25 for lunch special, the dish was ridiculously small.
1067;Compared to Ess-a, Tal offers a less doughy bagel!
1190;You have to increase the service a lot.
1275;Nothing better than buying a snapple for $3.25 too.
1385;Service is extraordinary, yet not overbearing, and the decor brings a taste of trendy SoHo into Queens.
1088;The dosas are skimpy, unattractive and drip with grease, and personally I'd drink popcorn topping before I'd eat another one of these.
1157;Right off the major deegan you get ladies from all over the city.
1129;The food was very good, but not very thai.
1078;The fillings may be unconventional but the dosa batter is definitely authentic and the combinations very tasty.
1268;The mussaman curry that I ordered was as thin as water and aside from the poorly fried tofu that I ordered in it, they graciously provided me with ONE piece of poorly cooked potato.
1151;Well, this place is so Ghetto its not even funny.
1227;Bagels are ok, but be sure not to make any special requests!
1409;I've had the lunch buffet at Chennai a couple of times, when I have been in the neighborhood.
135;And it all comes at a very reasonable price (congee, noodles, and rice dishes are no more than $3-6 each).
1456;You can certainly find restaurants that offer a superior fine dining experience, but for superb food at reasonable prices, La Villa can't be beat.
1271;The red curry is weak and tasteless, the pad thai is stuck together and lumpy, the rice is often overcooked, and the seafood is pretty sketchy.
1631;The wine list is extensive and can easily hike up an otherwise reasonably priced meal.
1371;The hanger steak was like rubber and the tuna was flavorless not to mention it tasted like it had just been thawed.
1596;Our son loves pizza and we have a certified Neapolitan pizzaria in our home city (Seattle), we liked this nearly as much - and the differences were more about personal preference than any reflection on either restaurant.
1232;big and soft as well as good lunch food.
1127;I liked the food at this quasi-thai restaurant.
1217;Unlike HH up the block, this place actually gives you hearty and hot bagels this town is known for.
1028;What generous portions!
1082;So, the menu is written in chalk above your head and it all sounds delicious.
1080;The highly spiced chai tea was great too.
1641;Seriously, this is the best all you can eat in town- As everyone says, the Spicy Tuna hand rolls are the best- have 4 of these, and you've broken even.
1724;But the best part about LS is the late night atmosphere, delightfully free of the BTs.
1031;You don't go to Mizu for excellent service, you go for the large amounts of food, the amiable atmosphere, and the hole-in-the-wall feeling of the place.
1205;This is the best sushi in new york city - hands down.
1419;The Thali was small, thoroughly unremarkable, and $14.95.
181;The food here is rather good, but only if you like to wait for it.
1465;though the service could be better (possibly due to more than one very large group in the house), it is very cordial and warm, as is the general clientele.
1544;This is a cute place and could be good but they need to get their act together.
1341;Service was very friendly.
1011;We actually left hungry and went across the street to Wo Hop at 15 Mott street for some good chinese food.
14;The whole set up is truly unprofessional and I wish Cafe Noir would get some good staff, because despite the current one this is a great place.
160;We ended our great experience by having Gulab Jamun (dessert) recommended by the waiter.
116;I have known about this secret for the last 13 years, Emilio(the Godfather) has continued to serve food and wine for the gods at mortal prices.
1010;And the bill was outragous.
1288;The owners and employees are friendly and their pizza is fantastic.
1723;The food is yummy, especially their cooked-to-perfection mussels in spicy tomato sauce and their shoestring crispy fries.
1795;It was like the servers forgot that they actually worked there and instead wanted to hang out and be cool.
1276;A great way to make some money is to buy a case of snapple from Costco and sell it right outside for only $2.50.
1519;The staff is excellent, specjal: that girl behind the bar, european chic.
1009;The service was bad, the food took to forever to come, we sat on the upper level.
1460;The decor is nice, but more casual than fine dining.
1338;Bottom line: B+ for the food, F for the service.
1625;The only thing the waiters don't do for you is wipe your chin when you leave.
1604;I've been to Naples 45 for dinner twice.
1440;The hot and sour soup was unbearably hot and tasted of only pepper and nothing else.
1771;believe us, we've been eating sushi for over 15 yrs.
1394;The atmosphere is much better than Sripraphai (more modern and sleek).
1708;I had a late dinner at Lucky Stike, a great name for a joint if ever I saw one.
1061;Service is fast and friendly.
1514;And they have these home made potato chips at the bar that are the most delicious things in the world!
130;The service is ok but could be better.
1683;The vibe is very relaxed and cozy, service was great and the food was excellent!
1171;Never in my life did I think that I could be satisfied both in taste and in quantity for $3.00 in NYC.
1518;this is the best secret place in midtown', I heard that from the bartender, after having brilliant food ( try steak with portobello mushrooms) and drinks on the bar last Tuesday.
1156;Jimmy's is hands down the hottest night spot in the Bronx.
1715;I would definitely go back -- if only for some of those exotic martinis on the blackboard.
1643;Stay away from the two specialty rolls on the menu, though- too much avocado and rice will fill you up right quick.
185;Also, specify if you like your food spicy- its rather bland if you don't.
1710;Our waiter was fine, the place looks nice in that not-trying-too-hard way, but at those prices, a little more should be expected of your food.
164;The entire place and the treatment we received felt as a conveyor belt.
1480;Joe's Pizza used to have the best slice until this pizzeria opened up.
1839;Food is great and inexpensive.
1756;The price very reasonable.
1097;I recommend this spot to anyone who enjoys  fine cuisine at reasonable prices.
1186;It only took about five or so minutes to get an empty table, but standing up wasn't too bad.
1295;The counter service is bad.
1491;The sauce is delicious and the crust is perfect.
1601;They have some great entrees here as well.
1794;Oh, but wait, we were out of drinks (which were also delightfully overpriced).
1163;The service is fantastic.
1109;The garlic mashed potatoes are hands down the best in the city!
1748;Great pizza and fantastic service.
1428;I went there for lunch and it was not as good as I expected from the reviews I read.
1639;The wine list isn't great, and the desserts are shipped in from Bruno's down the street, which is not as good as it used to be.
1417;I ordered a Lassi and asked 4 times for it but never got it.
1030;As far as the service goes, the waitresses were not particularly friendly, but they got the job done.
1782;Taxan delicious!
1649;This place has realy fresh sushi and a nice large menu of Japanese classic cuisine.
1195;The sushi is average and the prices are anything but.
1693;Owner must have coem on this website to give himself credit.
1496;Turned out there was full service upstairs and sat down.
1399;The food is consistently wonderful - I've been coming here for years, and the owner has always been accomodating and friendly.
1024;If you're looking for a place to sit down, have a drink and conversations with friends, go to sweet-n-tart and order yourself a hong-kong styled milk and tea with tapioca pearls (hot).
1483;They're also friendlier here, especially the owner, Kenny.
1701;Winnie and her staff are the best crew you can find serving you.
1086;You can even get packages of the chutneys to stock your fridge!
1231;Pick a bagel has the best bagels in the city.
1676;You are paying for the atmosphere, which is nice, but can be had in numerous places in Bay Ridge.
1699;The fried dumplings are GREAT!
147;This place has the best Chinese style BBQ ribs in the city.
1411;$6 and there is much tasty food, all of it fresh and continually refilled.
1566;Just straight up cheap, good food.
126;Seating is ok even though sometimes there's alot of people.
1207;Get the tuna of gari.
182;I like the somosas, chai, and the chole, but the dhosas and dhal were kinda dissapointing.
1416;Edible but really a ripoff at those prices given whats in the area.
1818;Service- friendly and attentive.
1718;Great food, great decor, great service.
1192;They sell special sushi, everything have a topping, sauce and etc.
1373;DO not try unless you're just going there to hang out like the rest of the hipsters who apparently have no sense of taste.
1325;I took my girlfriend there for her birthday last night and we had a relaxing, really good meal.
1528;I'm happy to have Nosh in the neighborhood and the food is very comforting.
1162;Good atmosphere, combination of all the hottest music dress code is relatively strict except on Fridays.
1716;Lucky Strike is a great casual place to just grab a bite to eat.
1003;Wonderful strawberry daiquiries as well!
1614;Going to Volare is like going to your favorite aunt's house for dinner, assuming that your aunt is a great Italian cook.
140;I fell in love with the egg noodles in the beef broth with shrimp dumplings and slices of BBQ roast pork.
1168;I keep my fingers crossed the whole subway ride hoping that there will be a table I can sit at by myself and not have to share with the rice congee soup people.
1060;Spreads and toppings are great - though a bit pricey.
1302;And their prices are very high - they actually think that they can get away with charging such prices for such terrible food and service!
1642;I've rarely had a problem with slow staff in the 10 years I've been going.
1766;Food is excellent.
1119;This wasn't the expected menu comprised only of pad thai and tom yum soup, but I thought that was what made the place so special.
1158;Good food at the restaurant (a bit expensive, but great if you want to impress your date).
1467;great eats, good times.
1123;Plus, when our entrees were held up in the kitchen on a busy Saturday night, the owner sent over complimentary summer rolls to hold us over!
1395;Another plus is most of the entrees are approx.
1366;The drinks are a saving grace, but service staff, please, get over yourselves.
1638;The prices are exceptionally reasonable for food of this caliber.
1534;I didn't expect to like Nosh as much as I did, but the pastrami on challah sandwich I had was otherworldly, the soups are like Mom's, and the knishes give Yonah Schimmel's a run for its money.
1778;The atmosphere is nothing special, but it feels like a Sushi establishment in Tokyo.
1733;Decor is charming.
1358;Really tasty spring rolls and noodles for a good price though.
1170;I go back in line like three times on average until I can't walk anymore.
1326;They treated us well and the food was extremely fresh and well-prepared.
1627;Volare virgins or weekly regulars, everyone gets treated the same and you can't ask for more than that when the service is this friendly.
1558;While this can hardly be called a restaurant, it is possibly the best deal in Manhatten: $4 for a plate heaped with rice and 2-3 entrees.
1540;They showed up 15 minutes after the tuna melt.
1508;they did give a 15% discount at the end, wasn't enough, as they knew the service was horrible.
1610;The pizza was great.
1139;I had never had Edamame pureed before but I thought it was innovative and tasty (could've used a bit more salt).
1808;however, it's the service that leaves a bad taste in my mouth.
1398;Delicious food, excellent service, and a pretty atmosphere make this a great choice for dinner and the $5.99 lunch buffet makes it an even better choice for lunch!
1038;The service was mediocre, and the lack of air conditioning made for a less than comfortable meal.
1770;honestly the worst sushi my husband and i had in our entire lives.
151;However, if you want great food at a great price and don't mind the decor, you can't beat this place.
1423;What makes this restaurant special are the authentic sichuan cooking and being the only one in NYC that offers authentic chongqing hotpot.
1851;Service was on par but not wonderful.
1539;We also ordered two hot dogs thinking they would be pretty good since there is a whole section on the menu devoted to them.
1687;The dish had like 6 pieces of beef in it.
137;This place is always very crowded and popular.
1462;Appetizers are somewhere around $7 each and the main dishes are between $11 and $16.
1605;I've had pizza both times and the caprese salad appetizer.
1447;He was terribly thirsty after the meal too.
1430;If you like the food and the value you get from some of Chinatown restaurants, this is not the place for you.
1536;Get the soup and a nosh (pastrami sandwich) for $8 and you're golden.
1420;Note that they do not serve beer, you must bring your own.
1027;We shared a bottle of sake, an order of edamames, and she had the sushi plate while I had the sashimi.
1735;I can't believe people complain about no cheese sticks?
