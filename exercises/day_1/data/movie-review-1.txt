"Ex Machina," released in 2014 and directed by Alex Garland, is a gripping science fiction movie that tackles the big questions about artificial intelligence (AI). The film stars Domhnall Gleeson as Caleb, a young programmer, Alicia Vikander as Ava, an AI with a human-like appearance, and Oscar Isaac as Nathan, the brilliant and eccentric CEO who created Ava.

Set in a stunning, remote estate that feels both luxurious and isolating, the movie's story revolves around Caleb, who wins a company contest to spend a week at Nathan's private residence. Once there, he discovers that he's part of an experiment involving Ava. The movie becomes a mind-bending journey into the ethical and psychological implications of AI, challenging viewers to consider what it means to be human.

While the film looks sleek and modern, it's the performances that really stand out. Gleeson portrays Caleb's mix of curiosity and vulnerability perfectly, while Isaac's Nathan is unpredictably fascinating. Vikander's Ava is the real star, though. She's mesmerizing, making you question the line between human and machine.

"Ex Machina" explores AI with depth, not just as a cool tech concept but as a profound ethical and philosophical issue. It's right up there with classics like "Blade Runner" and "The Terminator," asking big questions about identity and the potential dangers of AI.

However, the movie isn't perfect. It builds tension brilliantly but rushes towards an ending that feels abrupt and leaves some questions hanging. The ending, while impactful, could have used a bit more of the subtlety that the rest of the movie has in spades.

In a nutshell, "Ex Machina" is a visually stunning, intellectually stimulating film that's definitely worth a watch. It'll make you think about the future of AI and what it means for our understanding of humanity. But don't expect all the answersâ€”like the best sci-fi, it leaves you pondering long after the credits roll.
