# Masterclass: Large Language Models for Data Science
![](./slides/day_1/figures/pair-programming-with-llms.webp)

Welcome to this Masterclass on Large Language Models for Data Science. This course is designed for data scientists, data analysts, researchers, and AI enthusiasts in general looking to deepen their understanding of LLMs such as ChatGPT, Deepseek, Llama, Mistral, Phi, etc., along with their application ins various fields.
This Masterclass contains examples in both `Python` but should also be accesible to users with an `R` background. The old version of the masterclass was more R focused and is still accesible via the git-history.

## Using the Masterclass

This Masterclass was developed using `Quarto`. I highly recommend installing it if you intend to work through these exercises.

- `Python`: Using the `VS Code`-IDE allows you to interactively work with the .qmd files, just like with .ipynb files.

The timetable below has links to all the slides, exercises and solutions. The slides were rendered to the `RevealJS`-html format, which means all the slides can be opened directly in the browser and have many interactive features; press `?` for an overview. In my experience the edge and chrome browsers have trouble with some of the slides. Firefox does not seem to have any issues so far.

**Main branch**\
The main branch contains all the source `Quarto` and `Python` code for the masterclass.\
\
**gh_pages**\
This branch is used for hosting the full Masterclass on github. This branch contains the full Masterclass in the `./CourseMaterials` folder. All the html-files, datasets and figures can be found there.

## Timetable day 1

The first day of the Masterclass is a general introduction discussing the following points:

- What are LLMs and what is the recipe for making them?
- What can LLMs do?
- What are best practices for interacting with LLMs? (Prompting)
- How to download and work with open-weights LLM models
- What are ethical considerations you need to be aware of when using LLMs?
- How can we use LLMs as pair-programming buddies?

# Repository structure

This course's materials were rendered using `Quarto` to create `RevealJS`-html slides. The raw files for the slides, excercises, and solutions to exercises can be found under the `main` branch in the  `./slides/`, `./exercises`, `./exercises/*/solutions/` folders respectively.

On the `gh_pages` branch you will find the figures, datasets, and html files for the slides. The `gh_pages` branch is used to host the full Masterclass on github.
The general structure for the codebase and the rendered masterclass is as follows:
